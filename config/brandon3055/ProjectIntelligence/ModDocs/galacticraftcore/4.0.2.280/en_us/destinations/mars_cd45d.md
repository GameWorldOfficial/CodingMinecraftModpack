Mars is the second planet ever added to Galacticraft. Its surface consists of brownish-reddish blocks and is quite irregular with craters, mountains, deep valleys and a special crater which is the entrance for the Mars Dungeon. Unlike on the moon, you do not leave footprints. Meteors may also fall on Mars.

You can jump up to 3.375 blocks here. The gravity on the planet is 38%, so the fall damage is also 38% of Overworld's. You need to fall more than 8 meters to start getting fall damage, unlike the 3 meters on the Overworld (3 m / 0.38 ≈ 7.89 m), and more than 60 meters for a fatal fall ((20 HP / 0.38) + 7.89 m ≈ 60.53 m).

Just like the Moon, Mars has no Oxygen. Living on Mars is harder than living on the Moon because there is no water, trees or villages where you can seek protection and resources. Also in Galacticraft 3 and Galacticraft 4 you will require Thermal Padding to survive the cold temperatures on Mars (especially at night).

Mars's dimension number is -29.

Prerequisites
Currently, Mars can only be reached with the use of a Tier 2 Rocket, as opposed to a Tier 1 Rocket. Thus, trying to fly to Mars with a Tier 1 Rocket is impossible. Tier 2 rocket schematics can be found in moon dungeons.

Day-night cycle
Mars's day-night cycle is synchronized with Overworld's, and is therefore 20 minutes long, made up of 10 minutes of daylight and 10 minutes of night.

After sunset, the environment darkens but not as much as the Moon's and hostile mobs will be able to spawn on surface. Since the sunrise and sunset of both planets happen at the same time, the best moment to travel to Mars is during the Overworld's dawn (about 1.5 minutes before the sunrise), so that you have enough time to set up a quick base on Mars before the sunset.

Due to a bug in Galacticraft 2, the sun and stars were visible only on far-view distance. It is now fixed.

Geological Features
Surface

Mars terrain (true color).

Mars topography (the brighter, the higher).
The surface of Mars is riddled with craters, tall hills and deep valleys and its height may vary sharply from y=50 to y=140. It is covered by Mars Surface Rock and, underneath it, Mars Sub-Surface Rock. The martian soil is completely sterile, unless you use a Terraformer to convert it into cultivable soil.

In Galacticraft 3 and Galacticraft 4 there are rare patches of Ice under the surface.

Underground
The planet's underground features include caves like those of the Overworld's and also huge sludge-flooded caverns which are large and tall circular rooms underground, where poisonous plants, the Cavernous Vines, grow from the ceiling and the floor is mostly flooded with Bacterial Sludge.

Tin, copper, iron and Desh ores can be found on Mars. Desh is an important ingredient for some of the more advanced blocks and items in Galacticraft! And Desh armor gives very solid tank-like protection, including reduced knockbacks.

Naturally generated lava and water pools do not exist on Mars.

Structures
Mars features only one kind of generated structures: Mars Dungeon.

Mobs
Slimeling
Slimelings are tameable mobs found on Mars. Slimeling Eggs have a chance to spawn on the surface of Mars. They can be red, blue or yellow. They can be renamed and fed to create mini-slime bodyguards.

Sludgeling
Sludgelings are some kind of macro-bacteria that spawn in swarms in the Bacterial Sludge. They attack any mob, including the players. A Sludgeling swarm takes place when any mob touches or gets close enough to the bacterial sludge.

Boss
The Mars boss is the Evolved Creeper Boss, which can be found in the Mars dungeons. The boss is a three-headed giant Creeper that has an Oxygen Mask and shoots TNT at the player on sight.
