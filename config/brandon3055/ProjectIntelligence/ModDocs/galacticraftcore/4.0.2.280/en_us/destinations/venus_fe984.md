Venus is the name of the 4th and latest dimension to be added in Galacticraft 4. It is a Nether-like place with steep mountains, vapor, lava and lots of dangers.


Accessing

The Venus entry.
To access Venus, the player needs a Tier 3 Rocket to travel to it. Once accessed, the player will land on the surface with the aid of an Entry Pod.

Besides Breathing Equipment, the player must be also wearing a full set of Tier 2 Thermal Padding - the Thermal Padding is needed even in order to survive while inside the Entry Pod.

Environment
Day-night cycle, sky and weather
Day length: 10 hours, 30 Overworld days (720,000 ticks). ~5.5 hours daytime, ~4.5 hours nighttime.
It is highly recommended to bring a Cryogenic Chamber to skip long nights.
Tip: Divide Overworld days (from debug screen, F3) by 15. If the result is: even number = daytime, odd = nighttime

The sky:


The Venus sky.
The Sun moves backwards in the sky: rises in the west and sets in the east. This is a nice detail added by the developers, as in the real world Venus`s rotation is flipped aswell.
Daytime: it's very hard to spot the sun due to the thick clouds.
Nighttime: the Overworld and stars barely can be seen, giving no light. That means its pitch black.
Weather:

Very hot and corrosive environment. Obtain the Shield Controller to protect your armor against corrosion.
Constant lightning storm. The lightning bolts never reach the ground.
Frequent acidic rain. The rain never reaches the ground: it is too hot. (Rain seen from build 173.)


Atmosphere
The atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide and 3% nitrogen
(Trace elements of other gases are not present in the game)
A Methane Synthesizer can use the atmospheric CO2, so that it does not need a source of carbon.

About 61%.
It is possible to jump 2 blocks high.
Fall damage starts from 8.46 m.
Fatal fall starts from 59.25 m.
