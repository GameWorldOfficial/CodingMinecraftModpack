Asteroids is the name of the 3rd dimension in Galacticraft 3. It is farther away than Mars.

The entire dimension is made of floating rocks varying in size, from 1 up 30 blocks large. The gravity is very low (microgravity). A player without the ability to fly can jump from asteroid to asteroid - there are enough small rocks between the large ones that that is normally possible, at least with the help of a Grapple.

Asteroids' dimension number is -30.

Prerequisites
The Asteroids can only be reached with the use of a Tier 3 Rocket. Thus, trying to fly to this dimension with a Tier 1 Rocket or Tier 2 Rocket is impossible. Tier 3 Rocket Schematic can be found in a Mars Dungeon.

Day-night cycle
The Sun does not move, it is always still on West. The Sun is not bright here due to the distance, making the whole dimension relatively dark.

Geological Features

Asteroids terrain (true color).

Asteroids topography (the brighter, the higher).
The asteroids are made of rock and ice blocks. Ores can also be found, including iron ore, aluminum ore and Ilmenite Ore which can be used to produce Titanium.

From version 3.0.6: Some asteroids have a core which is rich in ores: these can include

Ilmenite Ore
Iron Ore
Aluminum Ore
Silicon Ore (rare, 4% chance)
Solid Meteoric Iron (very rare, < 2% chance)
vanilla Diamond Ore (very rare, < 2% chance)

Note: servers and players with existing worlds from before version 3.0.6 will have to delete the old Asteroids dimension (DIM-30) from the world save folder and have it re-generate, to have the new ores and the new lighting.
Structures
For now, there are only few structures inside some asteroids. In the future other structures will be added.

Hollow Asteroid
Hollow Asteroid is a hollowed-out asteroid with some kind of "hidden garden" inside. Normally they are 30x30 wide; their outside is covered with Dense Ice and the inside is made of dark Asteroid Rocks and there is a big room with grass and Glowstone. Depending on the occurrence, there may be dwarf Oak Trees and Poppies on the grass.

Despite the Glowstone, hostile mobs can spawn in there, so be careful to get rid of them first before entering. Evolved Creepers can blow up the thin shell of the asteroid and you may fall into the void.

Abandoned Base
The Abandoned Base is a structure added in Galacticraft 4 in the Asteroids dimension. See more on the Abandoned Base page.

Mobs
Moving small asteroids can damage the player, so stay out of their way.

Evolved Zombies, Evolved Skeletons, Evolved Spiders and Evolved Creepers can spawn in dark spots.
