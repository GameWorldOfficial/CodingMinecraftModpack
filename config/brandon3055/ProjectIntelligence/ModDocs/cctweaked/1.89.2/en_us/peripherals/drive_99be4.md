drive
Disk drives are a peripheral which allow you to read and write to floppy disks and other "mountable media" (such as computers or turtles). They also allow you to play records.

When a disk drive attaches some mount (such as a floppy disk or computer), it attaches a folder called disk, disk2, etc... to the root directory of the computer. This folder can be used to interact with the files on that disk.

When a disk is inserted, a disk event is fired, with the side peripheral is on. Likewise, when the disk is detached, a disk_eject event is fired.
