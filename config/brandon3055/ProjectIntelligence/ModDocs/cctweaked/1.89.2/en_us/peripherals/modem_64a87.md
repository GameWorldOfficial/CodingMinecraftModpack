modem
Modems allow you to send messages between computers over long distances.

TIP
Modems provide a fairly basic set of methods, which makes them very flexible but often hard to work with. The rednet API is built on top of modems, and provides a more user-friendly interface.

Sending and receiving messages
Modems operate on a series of channels, a bit like frequencies on a radio. Any modem can send a message on a particular channel, but only those which have opened the channel and are "listening in" can receive messages.

Channels are represented as an integer between 0 and 65535 inclusive. These channels don't have any defined meaning, though some APIs or programs will assign a meaning to them. For instance, the gps module sends all its messages on channel 65534 (gps.CHANNEL_GPS), while rednet uses channels equal to the computer's ID.

Sending messages is done with the transmit message.
Receiving messages is done by listening to the modem_message event.
Types of modem
CC: Tweaked comes with three kinds of modem, with different capabilities.

Wireless modems: Wireless modems can send messages to any other wireless modem. They can be placed next to a computer, or equipped as a pocket computer or turtle upgrade.

Wireless modems have a limited range, only sending messages to modems within 64 blocks. This range increases linearly once the modem is above y=96, to a maximum of 384 at world height.

Ender modems: These are upgraded versions of normal wireless modems. They do not have a distance limit, and can send messages between dimensions.

Wired modems: These send messages to other any other wired modems connected to the same network (using Networking Cable). They also can be used to attach additional peripherals to a computer.

Usage
Wrap a modem and a message on channel 15, requesting a response on channel 43. Then wait for a message to arrive on channel 43 and print it.

Run ·êÖlocal modem = peripheral.find("modem") or error("No modem attached", 0)
modem.open(43) -- Open 43 so we can receive replies

-- Send our message
modem.transmit(15, 43, "Hello, world!")

-- And wait for a reply
local event, side, channel, replyChannel, message, distance
repeat
  event, side, channel, replyChannel, message, distance = os.pullEvent("modem_message")
until channel == 43

print("Received a reply: " .. tostring(message))

open(channel)
Source
Open a channel on a modem. A channel must be open in order to receive messages. Modems can have up to 128 channels open at one time.

Parameters
channel number The channel to open. This must be a number between 0 and 65535.
Throws
If the channel is out of range.

If there are too many open channels.

isOpen(channel)
Source
Check if a channel is open.

Parameters
channel number The channel to check.
Returns
boolean Whether the channel is open.
Throws
If the channel is out of range.

close(channel)
Source
Close an open channel, meaning it will no longer receive messages.

Parameters
channel number The channel to close.
Throws
If the channel is out of range.

closeAll()
Source
Close all open channels.

transmit(channel, replyChannel, payload)
Source
Sends a modem message on a certain channel. Modems listening on the channel will queue a modem_message event on adjacent computers.

üõà NOTE
The channel does not need be open to send a message.

Parameters
channel number The channel to send messages on.
replyChannel number The channel that responses to this message should be sent on. This can be the same as channel or entirely different. The channel must have been opened on the sending computer in order to receive the replies.
payload any The object to send. This can be any primitive type (boolean, number, string) as well as tables. Other types (like functions), as well as metatables, will not be transmitted.
Throws
If the channel is out of range.

Usage
Wrap a modem and a message on channel 15, requesting a response on channel 43.

Run ·êÖlocal modem = peripheral.find("modem") or error("No modem attached", 0)
modem.transmit(15, 43, "Hello, world!")
isWireless()
Source
Determine if this is a wired or wireless modem.

Some methods (namely those dealing with wired networks and remote peripherals) are only available on wired modems.

Returns
boolean true if this is a wireless modem.
getNamesRemote()
Source
List all remote peripherals on the wired network.

If this computer is attached to the network, it will not be included in this list.

üõà NOTE

Returns
{ string... } Remote peripheral names on the network.
isPresentRemote(name)
Source
Determine if a peripheral is available on this wired network.

üõà NOTE

Changes
Changed in version 1.99: Peripherals can have multiple types - this function returns multiple values.
