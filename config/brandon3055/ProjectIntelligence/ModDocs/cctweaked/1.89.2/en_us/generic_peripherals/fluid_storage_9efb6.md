fluid_storage
Methods for interacting with tanks and other fluid storage blocks.

tanks()	Get all "tanks" in this fluid storage.
pushFluid(toName [, limit [, fluidName]])	Move a fluid from one fluid container to another connected one.
pullFluid(fromName [, limit [, fluidName]])	Move a fluid from a connected fluid container into this oneone.
tanks()
Source
Get all "tanks" in this fluid storage.

Each tank either contains some amount of fluid or is empty. Tanks with fluids inside will return some basic information about the fluid, including its name and amount.

The returned table is sparse, and so empty tanks will be nil - it is recommended to loop over using pairs rather than ipairs.

Returns
{ table | nil... } All tanks in this fluid storage.
pushFluid(toName [, limit [, fluidName]])
Source
Move a fluid from one fluid container to another connected one.

This allows you to pull fluid in the current fluid container to another container on the same wired network. Both containers must attached to wired modems which are connected via a cable.

Parameters
toName string The name of the peripheral/container to push to. This is the string given to peripheral.wrap, and displayed by the wired modem.
limit? number The maximum amount of fluid to move.
fluidName? string The fluid to move. If not given, an arbitrary fluid will be chosen.
Returns
number The amount of moved fluid.
Throws
If the peripheral to transfer to doesn't exist or isn't an fluid container.

peripheral.getName Allows you to get the name of a wrapped peripheral.
pullFluid(fromName [, limit [, fluidName]])
Source
Move a fluid from a connected fluid container into this oneone.

This allows you to pull fluid in the current fluid container from another container on the same wired network. Both containers must attached to wired modems which are connected via a cable.

Parameters
fromName string The name of the peripheral/container to push to. This is the string given to peripheral.wrap, and displayed by the wired modem.
limit? number The maximum amount of fluid to move.
fluidName? string The fluid to move. If not given, an arbitrary fluid will be chosen.
Returns
number The amount of moved fluid.
Throws
If the peripheral to transfer to doesn't exist or isn't an fluid container.

peripheral.getName Allows you to get the name of a wrapped peripheral.
