_G
Functions in the global environment, defined in bios.lua. This does not include standard Lua functions.

sleep(time) Pauses execution for the specified number of seconds.
write(text) Writes a line of text to the screen without a newline at the end, wrapping text if necessary.
print(...) Prints the specified values to the screen separated by spaces, wrapping if necessary.
printError(...) Prints the specified values to the screen in red, separated by spaces, wrapping if necessary.
read([replaceChar [, history [, completeFn [, default]]]])	Reads user input from the terminal.
_HOST Stores the current ComputerCraft and Minecraft versions.
_CC_DEFAULT_SETTINGS The default computer settings as defined in the ComputerCraft configuration.
sleep(time)
Source
Pauses execution for the specified number of seconds.

As it waits for a fixed amount of world ticks, time will automatically be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 0.05 seconds. If you are using coroutines or the parallel API, it will only pause execution of the current thread, not the whole program.

TIP
Because sleep internally uses timers, it is a function that yields. This means that you can use it to prevent "Too long without yielding" errors, however, as the minimum sleep time is 0.05 seconds, it will slow your program down.

âš  CAUTION
Internally, this function queues and waits for a timer event (using os.startTimer), however it does not listen for any other events. This means that any event that occurs while sleeping will be entirely discarded. If you need to receive events while sleeping, consider using timers, or the parallel API.

Parameters
time number The number of seconds to sleep for, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 0.05.
Usage
Sleep for three seconds.

Run print("Sleeping for three seconds")
sleep (3)
print("Done!")

os.startTimer
write(text)
Source
Writes a line of text to the screen without a newline at the end, wrapping text if necessary.

Parameters
text string The text to write to the string
Returns
number The number of lines written
Usage
Run write("Hello, world")
See also
print A wrapper around write that adds a newline and accepts multiple arguments
print(...)
Source
Prints the specified values to the screen separated by spaces, wrapping if necessary. After printing, the cursor is moved to the next line.

Parameters
... The values to print on the screen
Returns
number The number of lines written
Usage
Run print("Hello, world!")
printError(...)
Source
Prints the specified values to the screen in red, separated by spaces, wrapping if necessary. After printing, the cursor is moved to the next line.

Parameters
... The values to print on the screen
Usage
Run printError("Something went wrong!")
read([replaceChar [, history [, completeFn [, default]]]])
Source
Reads user input from the terminal. This automatically handles arrow keys, pasting, character replacement, history scrollback, auto-completion, and default values.

Parameters
replaceChar? string A character to replace each typed character with. This can be used for hiding passwords, for example.
history? table A table holding history items that can be scrolled back to with the up/down arrow keys. The oldest item is at index 1, while the newest item is at the highest index.
completeFn? function(partial: string):{ string... } | nil A function to be used for completion. This function should take the partial text typed so far, and returns a list of possible completion options.
default? string Default text which should already be entered into the prompt.
Returns
string The text typed in.
Usage
Read a string and echo it back to the user

Run write("> ")
local msg = read()
print(msg)
Prompt a user for a password.

Run while true do
  write("Password> ")
  local pwd = read("*")
  if pwd == "let me in" then break end
  print("Incorrect password, try again.")
end
print("Logged in!")
A complete example with completion, history and a default value.

Run local completion = require "cc.completion"
local history = { "potato", "orange", "apple" }
local choices = { "apple", "orange", "banana", "strawberry" }
write("> ")
local msg = read(nil, history, function(text) return completion.choice(text, choices) end, "app")
print(msg)
See also
cc.completion For functions to help with completion.
Changes
Changed in version 1.74: Added completeFn parameter.
Changed in version 1.80pr1: Added default parameter.
_HOST
Source
Stores the current ComputerCraft and Minecraft versions.

Outside of Minecraft (for instance, in an emulator) _HOST will contain the emulator's version instead.

For example, ComputerCraft 1.93.0 (Minecraft 1.15.2).

Usage
Print the current computer's environment.

Run print(_HOST)
Changes
New in version 1.76
_CC_DEFAULT_SETTINGS
Source
The default computer settings as defined in the ComputerCraft configuration.

This is a comma-separated list of settings pairs defined by the mod configuration or server owner. By default, it is empty.

An example value to disable autocompletion:

shell.autocomplete=false,lua.autocomplete=false,edit.autocomplete=false
Usage
Run _CC_DEFAULT_SETTINGS
Changes
New in version 1.77
