loadAPI(path)
Source
üõà DEPRECATED
When possible it's best to avoid using this function. It pollutes the global table and can mask errors.

require should be used to load libraries instead.

Loads the given API into the global environment.

This function loads and executes the file at the given path, and all global variables and functions exported by it will by available through the use of myAPI.<function name>, where myAPI is the base name of the API file.

Parameters
path string The path of the API to load.
Returns
boolean Whether or not the API was successfully loaded.
Changes
New in version 1.2
unloadAPI(name)
Source
üõà DEPRECATED
See os.loadAPI for why.

Unloads an API which was loaded by os.loadAPI.

This effectively removes the specified table from _G.

Parameters
name string The name of the API to unload.
Changes
New in version 1.2
pullEvent([filter])
Source
Pause execution of the current thread and waits for any events matching filter.

This function yields the current process and waits for it to be resumed with a vararg list where the first element matches filter. If no filter is supplied, this will match all events.

Unlike os.pullEventRaw, it will stop the application upon a "terminate" event, printing the error "Terminated".

Parameters
filter? string Event to filter for.
Returns
string event The name of the event that fired.
any param... Optional additional parameters of the event.
Usage
Listen for mouse_click events.

Run ·êÖwhile true do
    local event, button, x, y = os.pullEvent("mouse_click")
    print("Button", button, "was clicked at", x, ",", y)
end
Listen for multiple events.

Run ·êÖwhile true do
    local eventData = {os.pullEvent()}
    local event = eventData[1]

    if event == "mouse_click" then
        print("Button", eventData[2], "was clicked at", eventData[3], ",", eventData[4])
    elseif event == "key" then
        print("Key code", eventData[2], "was pressed")
    end
end
See also
os.pullEventRaw To pull the terminate event.
Changes
Changed in version 1.3: Added filter argument.
pullEventRaw([filter])
Source
Pause execution of the current thread and waits for events, including the terminate event.

This behaves almost the same as os.pullEvent, except it allows you to handle the terminate event yourself - the program will not stop execution when Ctrl+T is pressed.

Parameters
filter? string Event to filter for.
Returns
string event The name of the event that fired.
any param... Optional additional parameters of the event.
Usage
Listen for terminate events.

Run ·êÖwhile true do
    local event = os.pullEventRaw()
    if event == "terminate" then
        print("Caught terminate event!")
    end
end
See also
os.pullEvent To pull events normally.
sleep(time)
Source
Pauses execution for the specified number of seconds, alias of _G.sleep.

Parameters
time number The number of seconds to sleep for, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 0.05.
version()
Source
Get the current CraftOS version (for example, CraftOS 1.8).

This is defined by bios.lua. For the current version of CC:Tweaked, this should return CraftOS 1.8.

Returns
string The current CraftOS version.
Usage
Run ·êÖos.version()
run(env, path, ...)
Source
Run the program at the given path with the specified environment and arguments.

This function does not resolve program names like the shell does. This means that, for example, os.run("edit") will not work. As well as this, it does not provide access to the shell API in the environment. For this behaviour, use shell.run instead.

If the program cannot be found, or failed to run, it will print the error and return false. If you want to handle this more gracefully, use an alternative such as loadfile.

Parameters
env table The environment to run the program with.
path string The exact path of the program to run.
... The arguments to pass to the program.
Returns
boolean Whether or not the program ran successfully.
Usage
Run the default shell from within your program:

Run ·êÖos.run({}, "/rom/programs/shell.lua")
See also
shell.run
loadfile
queueEvent(name, ...)
Source
Adds an event to the event queue. This event can later be pulled with os.pullEvent.

Parameters
name string The name of the event to queue.
... The parameters of the event.
See also
os.pullEvent To pull the event queued
startTimer(timer)
Source
Starts a timer that will run for the specified number of seconds. Once the timer fires, a timer event will be added to the queue with the ID returned from this function as the first parameter.

As with sleep, timer will automatically be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 0.05 seconds, as it waits for a fixed amount of world ticks.

Parameters
timer number The number of seconds until the timer fires.
Returns
number The ID of the new timer. This can be used to filter the timer event, or cancel the timer.
Throws
If the time is below zero.

See also
cancelTimer To cancel a timer.
cancelTimer(token)
Source
Cancels a timer previously started with startTimer. This will stop the timer from firing.

Parameters
token number The ID of the timer to cancel.
See also
startTimer To start a timer.
setAlarm(time)
Source
Sets an alarm that will fire at the specified in-game time. When it fires, * an alarm event will be added to the event queue with the ID * returned from this function as the first parameter.

Parameters
time number The time at which to fire the alarm, in the range [0.0, 24.0).
Returns
number The ID of the new alarm. This can be used to filter the alarm event, or cancel the alarm.
Throws
If the time is out of range.

See also
cancelAlarm To cancel an alarm.
Changes
New in version 1.2
cancelAlarm(token)
Source
Cancels an alarm previously started with setAlarm. This will stop the alarm from firing.

Parameters
locale? string | table The locale of the time, or a table filled by os.date("*t") to decode. Defaults to ingame locale if not specified.
Returns
any The hour of the selected locale, or a UNIX timestamp from the table, depending on the argument passed in.
Throws
If an invalid locale is passed.

Usage

date([format [, time]])
Source
Returns a date string (or table) using a specified format string and optional time to format.

The format string takes the same formats as C's strftime function (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/strftime/). In extension, it can be prefixed with an exclamation mark (!) to use UTC time instead of the server's local timezone.

If the format is exactly *t (optionally prefixed with !), a table will be returned instead. This table has fields for the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, day of the week, day of the year, and whether Daylight Savings Time is in effect. This table can be converted to a UNIX timestamp (days since 1 January 1970) with date.

Parameters
format? string The format of the string to return. This defaults to %c, which expands to a string similar to "Sat Dec 24 16:58:00 2011".
time? number The time to convert to a string. This defaults to the current time.
Returns
any The resulting format string.
Throws
If an invalid format is passed.

Usage
Print the current date in a user-friendly string.
