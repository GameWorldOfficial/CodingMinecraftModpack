window
A terminal redirect occupying a smaller area of an existing terminal. This allows for easy definition of spaces within the display that can be written/drawn to, then later redrawn/repositioned/etc as need be. The API itself contains only one function, window.create, which returns the windows themselves.

Windows are considered terminal objects - as such, they have access to nearly all the commands in the term API (plus a few extras of their own, listed within said API) and are valid targets to redirect to.

Each window has a "parent" terminal object, which can be the computer's own display, a monitor, another window or even other, user-defined terminal objects. Whenever a window is rendered to, the actual screen-writing is performed via that parent (or, if that has one too, then that parent, and so forth). Bear in mind that the cursor of a window's parent will hence be moved around etc when writing a given child window.

Windows retain a memory of everything rendered "through" them (hence acting as display buffers), and if the parent's display is wiped, the window's content can be easily redrawn later. A window may also be flagged as invisible, preventing any changes to it from being rendered until it's flagged as visible once more.

A parent terminal object may have multiple children assigned to it, and windows may overlap. For example, the Multishell system functions by assigning each tab a window covering the screen, each using the starting terminal display as its parent, and only one of which is visible at a time.

create(parent, nX, nY, nWidth, nHeight [, bStartVisible])	Returns a terminal object that is a space within the specified parent terminal object.
create(parent, nX, nY, nWidth, nHeight [, bStartVisible])
Source
Returns a terminal object that is a space within the specified parent terminal object. This can then be used (or even redirected to) in the same manner as eg a wrapped monitor. Refer to the term API for a list of functions available to it.

term itself may not be passed as the parent, though term.native is acceptable. Generally, term.current or a wrapped monitor will be most suitable, though windows may even have other windows assigned as their parents.

Parameters
parent term.Redirect The parent terminal redirect to draw to.
nX number The x coordinate this window is drawn at in the parent terminal
nY number The y coordinate this window is drawn at in the parent terminal
nWidth number The width of this window
nHeight number The height of this window
bStartVisible? boolean Whether this window is visible by default. Defaults to true.
Returns
Window The constructed window
Usage
Create a smaller window, fill it red and write some text to it.

Run ᐅlocal my_window = window.create(term.current(), 1, 1, 20, 5)
my_window.setBackgroundColour(colours.red)
my_window.setTextColour(colours.white)
my_window.clear()
my_window.write("Testing my window!")
Create a smaller window and redirect to it.

Run ᐅlocal my_window = window.create(term.current(), 1, 1, 25, 5)
term.redirect(my_window)
print("Writing some long text which will wrap around and show the bounds of this window.")

Window.getPosition()
Source
Get the position of the top left corner of this window.

Returns
number The x position of this window.
number The y position of this window.
Window.reposition(new_x, new_y [, new_width, new_height [, new_parent]])
Source
Reposition or resize the given window.

This function also accepts arguments to change the size of this window. It is recommended that you fire a term_resize event after changing a window's, to allow programs to adjust their sizing.

Parameters

new_y number The new y position of this window.
new_width? number The new width of this window.
new_height number The new height of this window.
new_parent? term.Redirect The new redirect object this window should draw to.
