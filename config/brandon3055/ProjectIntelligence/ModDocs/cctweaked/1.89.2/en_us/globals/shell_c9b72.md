shell
The shell API provides access to CraftOS's command line interface.

It allows you to start programs, add completion for a program, and much more.

shell is not a "true" API. Instead, it is a standard program, which injects its API into the programs that it launches. This allows for multiple shells to run at the same time, but means that the API is not available in the global environment, and so is unavailable to other APIs.

execute(command, ...)	Run a program with the supplied arguments.
run(...)	Run a program with the supplied arguments.
exit()	Exit the current shell.
dir()	Return the current working directory.
setDir(dir)	Set the current working directory.
path()	Set the path where programs are located.
setPath(path)	Set the current program path.

execute(command, ...)
Source
Run a program with the supplied arguments.

Unlike shell.run, each argument is passed to the program verbatim. While shell.run("echo", "b c") runs echo with b and c, shell.execute("echo", "b c") runs echo with a single argument b c.

Parameters
command string The program to execute.
... string Arguments to this program.
Returns
boolean Whether the program exited successfully.
Usage
Run paint my-image from within your program:

Run ᐅshell.execute("paint", "my-image")
Changes
New in version 1.88.0
run(...)
Source
Run a program with the supplied arguments.

All arguments are concatenated together and then parsed as a command line. As a result, shell.run("program a b") is the same as shell.run("program", "a", "b").

Parameters
... string The program to run and its arguments.
Returns
boolean Whether the program exited successfully.
Usage
Run paint my-image from within your program:

Run ᐅshell.run("paint", "my-image")
See also
shell.execute Run a program directly without parsing the arguments.
Changes
Changed in version 1.80pr1: Programs now get their own environment instead of sharing the same one.
Changed in version 1.83.0: arg is now added to the environment.
exit()
Source
Exit the current shell.

This does not terminate your program, it simply makes the shell terminate after your program has finished. If this is the toplevel shell, then the computer will be shutdown.

dir()
Source
Return the current working directory. This is what is displayed before the > of the shell prompt, and is used by shell.resolve to handle relative paths.

Returns
string The current working directory.
See also
setDir To change the working directory.
setDir(dir)
Source
Set the current working directory.

Parameters
dir string The new working directory.
Throws
If the path does not exist or is not a directory.

Usage
Set the working directory to "rom"

Run ᐅshell.setDir("rom")
path()
Source
Set the path where programs are located.

The path is composed of a list of directory names in a string, each separated by a colon (:). On normal turtles will look in the current directory (.), /rom/programs and /rom/programs/turtle folder, making the path .:/rom/programs:/rom/programs/turtle.

Returns
string The current shell's path.
See also
setPath To change the current path.
setPath(path)
Source
Set the current program path.

Be careful to prefix directories with a /. Otherwise they will be searched for from the current directory, rather than the computer's root.

Parameters
path string The new program path.
Changes
New in version 1.2
resolve(path)
Source
Resolve a relative path to an absolute path.

The fs and io APIs work using absolute paths, and so we must convert any paths relative to the current directory to absolute ones. This does nothing when the path starts with /.

Parameters
path string The path to resolve.
Usage
Resolve startup.lua when in the rom folder.

Run ᐅshell.setDir("rom")
print(shell.resolve("startup.lua"))
-- => rom/startup.lua
resolveProgram(command)
Source
Resolve a program, using the program path and list of aliases.

Parameters
command string The name of the program
Returns
string | nil The absolute path to the program, or nil if it could not be found.
Usage
Locate the hello program.

Run ᐅshell.resolveProgram("hello")
-- => rom/programs/fun/hello.lua
Changes
New in version 1.2
programs([include_hidden])
Source
Return a list of all programs on the path.

Parameters
include_hidden? boolean Include hidden files. Namely, any which start with ..
Returns
{ string } A list of available programs.
Usage
Run ᐅtextutils.tabulate(shell.programs())
Changes
New in version 1.2
complete(sLine)
Source
Complete a shell command line.

This accepts an incomplete command, and completes the program name or arguments. For instance, l will be completed to ls, and ls ro will be completed to ls rom/.

Completion handlers for your program may be registered with shell.setCompletionFunction.

Parameters
sLine string The input to complete.
Returns
{ string } | nil The list of possible completions.
See also
_G.read For more information about completion.
shell.completeProgram
shell.setCompletionFunction
shell.getCompletionInfo
Changes
New in version 1.74
completeProgram(program)
Source
Complete the name of a program.

Parameters
program string The name of a program to complete.
Returns
{ string } A list of possible completions.
See also
cc.shell.completion.program
setCompletionFunction(program, complete)
Source
Set the completion function for a program. When the program is entered on the command line, this program will be called to provide auto-complete information.

The completion function accepts four arguments:

The current shell. As completion functions are inherited, this is not guaranteed to be the shell you registered this function in.
The index of the argument currently being completed.
The current argument. This may be the empty string.
A list of the previous arguments.
For instance, when completing pastebin put rom/st our pastebin completion function will receive the shell API, an index of 2, rom/st as the current argument, and a "previous" table of { "put" }. This function may then wish to return a table containing artup.lua, indicating the entire command should be completed to pastebin put rom/startup.lua.

You completion entries may also be followed by a space, if you wish to indicate another argument is expected.

Parameters
program string The path to the program. This should be an absolute path without the leading /.
complete function(shell: table, index: number, argument: string, previous: { string }):{ string } | nil The completion function.
See also
cc.shell.completion Various utilities to help with writing completion functions.
shell.complete
_G.read For more information about completion.
Changes
New in version 1.74
getCompletionInfo()
Source
Get a table containing all completion functions.

This should only be needed when building custom shells. Use setCompletionFunction to add a completion function.

Returns
{ [string] = { fnComplete = function } } A table mapping the absolute path of programs, to their completion functions.
getRunningProgram()
Source
Returns the path to the currently running program.

Returns
string The absolute path to the running program.
Changes
New in version 1.3
setAlias(command, program)
Source
Add an alias for a program.

Parameters
command string The name of the alias to add.
program string The name or path to the program.
Usage
Alias vim to the edit program

Run ᐅshell.setAlias("vim", "edit")
Changes
New in version 1.2
clearAlias(command)
Source
Remove an alias.

Parameters
command string The alias name to remove.
aliases()
Source
Get the current aliases for this shell.

Aliases are used to allow multiple commands to refer to a single program. For instance, the list program is aliased dir or ls. Running ls, dir or list in the shell will all run the list program.

Returns
{ [string] = string } A table, where the keys are the names of aliases, and the values are the path to the program.
See also
shell.setAlias
shell.resolveProgram This uses aliases when resolving a program name to an absolute path.
openTab(...)
Source
Open a new multishell tab running a command.

This behaves similarly to shell.run, but instead returns the process index.

This function is only available if the multishell API is.

Parameters
... string The command line to run.
Usage
Launch the Lua interpreter and switch to it.

Run ᐅlocal id = shell.openTab("lua")
shell.switchTab(id)
See also
shell.run
multishell.launch
Changes
New in version 1.6
switchTab(id)
Source
Switch to the multishell tab with the given index.

Parameters
id number The tab to switch to.
