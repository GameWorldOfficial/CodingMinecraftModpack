turtle
Turtles are a robotic device, which can break and place blocks, attack mobs, and move about the world. They have an internal inventory of 16 slots, allowing them to store blocks they have broken or would like to place.

Movement
Turtles are capable of moving through the world. As turtles are blocks themselves, they are confined to Minecraft's grid, moving a single block at a time.

turtle.forward and turtle.back move the turtle in the direction it is facing, while turtle.up and turtle.down move it up and down (as one might expect!). In order to move left or right, you first need to turn the turtle using turtle.turnLeft/turtle.turnRight and then move forward or backwards.

🛈 INFO
The name "turtle" comes from Turtle graphics, which originated from the Logo programming language. Here you'd move a turtle with various commands like "move 10" and "turn left", much like ComputerCraft's turtles!

Moving a turtle (though not turning it) consumes fuel. If a turtle does not have any fuel, it won't move, and the movement functions will return false. If your turtle isn't going anywhere, the first thing to check is if you've fuelled your turtle.

HANDLING ERRORS
Many turtle functions can fail in various ways. For instance, a turtle cannot move forward if there's already a block there. Instead of erroring, functions which can fail either return true if they succeed, or false and some error message if they fail.

Unexpected failures can often lead to strange behaviour. It's often a good idea to check the return values of these functions, or wrap them in assert (for instance, use assert(turtle.forward()) rather than turtle.forward()), so the program doesn't misbehave.

Turtle upgrades
While a normal turtle can move about the world and place blocks, its functionality is limited. Thankfully, turtles can be upgraded with tools and peripherals. Turtles have two upgrade slots, one on the left and right sides. Upgrades can be equipped by crafting a turtle with the upgrade, or calling the turtle.equipLeft/turtle.equipRight functions.

Turtle tools allow you to break blocks (turtle.dig) and attack entities (turtle.attack). Some tools are more suitable to a task than others. For instance, a diamond pickaxe can break every block, while a sword does more damage. Other tools have more niche use-cases, for instance hoes can til dirt.

Peripherals (such as the wireless modem or speaker) can also be equipped as upgrades. These are then accessible by accessing the "left" or "right" peripheral.

refuel
Changes
New in version 1.4
refuel([count])
Source
Refuel this turtle.

While most actions a turtle can perform (such as digging or placing blocks) are free, moving consumes fuel from the turtle's internal buffer. If a turtle has no fuel, it will not move.

refuel refuels the turtle, consuming fuel items (such as coal or lava buckets) from the currently selected slot and converting them into energy. This finishes once the turtle is fully refuelled or all items have been consumed.

Parameters
count? number The maximum number of items to consume. One can pass 0 to check if an item is combustable or not.
Returns
true If the turtle was refuelled.
Or
false If the turtle was not refuelled.
string The reason the turtle was not refuelled (
Throws
If the refuel count is out of range.

Usage
Refuel a turtle from the currently selected slot.

Run ᐅlocal level = turtle.getFuelLevel()
if new_level == "unlimited" then error("Turtle does not need fuel", 0) end

local ok, err = turtle.refuel()
if ok then
  local new_level = turtle.getFuelLevel()
  print(("Refuelled %d, current level is %d"):format(new_level - level, new_level))
else
  printError(err)
end
Check if the current item is a valid fuel source.
