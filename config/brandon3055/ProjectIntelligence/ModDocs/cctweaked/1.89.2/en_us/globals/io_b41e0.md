io
Emulates Lua's standard io library.

stdin	A file handle representing the "standard input".
stdout	A file handle representing the "standard output".
stderr	A file handle representing the "standard error" stream.
close([file])	Closes the provided file handle.
flush()	Flushes the current output file.
input([file])	Get or set the current input file.
lines([filename, ...])	Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator that, each time it is called, returns a new line from the file.
open(filename [, mode])	Open a file with the given mode, either returning a new file handle or nil, plus an error message.
output([file])	Get or set the current output file.
read(...)	Read from the currently opened input file.
type(obj)	Checks whether handle is a given file handle, and determine if it is open or not.
write(...)	Write to the currently opened output file.
stdin
Source
A file handle representing the "standard input". Reading from this file will prompt the user for input.

stdout
Source
A file handle representing the "standard output". Writing to this file will display the written text to the screen.

stderr
Source
A file handle representing the "standard error" stream.

One may use this to display error messages, writing to it will display them on the terminal.

close([file])
Source
Closes the provided file handle.

Parameters
file? Handle The file handle to close, defaults to the current output file.
See also
Handle:close
io.output
Changes
New in version 1.55
flush()
Source
Flushes the current output file.

See also
Handle:flush
io.output
Changes
New in version 1.55
input([file])
Source
Get or set the current input file.

Parameters
file? Handle | string The new input file, either as a file path or pre-existing handle.
Returns
Handle The current input file.
Throws
If the provided filename cannot be opened for reading.

Changes
New in version 1.55
lines([filename, ...])
Source
Opens the given file name in read mode and returns an iterator that, each time it is called, returns a new line from the file.

This can be used in a for loop to iterate over all lines of a file

Once the end of the file has been reached, nil will be returned. The file is automatically closed.

If no file name is given, the current input will be used instead. In this case, the handle is not used.

Parameters
filename? string The name of the file to extract lines from
... The argument to pass to Handle:read for each line.
Returns
function():string | nil The line iterator.
Throws
If the file cannot be opened for reading

Usage
Iterate over every line in a file and print it out.

Run ·êÖfor line in io.lines("/rom/help/intro.txt") do
  print(line)
end

Handle:lines
io.input
Changes
New in version 1.55
open(filename [, mode])
Source
Open a file with the given mode, either returning a new file handle or nil, plus an error message.

The mode string can be any of the following:

"r": Read mode
"w": Write mode
"a": Append mode
The mode may also have a b at the end, which opens the file in "binary mode". This allows you to read binary files, as well as seek within a file.

Parameters
filename string The name of the file to open.
mode? string The mode to open the file with. This defaults to rb.
Returns
Handle The opened file.
Or
nil In case of an error.
string The reason the file could not be opened.
output([file])
Source
Get or set the current output file.

Parameters
file? Handle | string The new output file, either as a file path or pre-existing handle.
Returns
Handle The current output file.
Throws
If the provided filename cannot be opened for writing.

Changes
New in version 1.55
read(...)
Source
Read from the currently opened input file.

This is equivalent to io.input():read(...). See the documentation there for full details.

Parameters
... string The formats to read, defaulting to a whole line.
Returns
string | nil... The data read, or nil if nothing can be read.
type(obj)
Source
Checks whether handle is a given file handle, and determine if it is open or not.

Parameters
obj The value to check
Returns
string | nil "file" if this is an open file, "closed file" if it is a closed file handle, or nil if not a file handle.
write(...)
Source
Write to the currently opened output file.

This is equivalent to io.output():write(...). See the documentation there for full details.

Parameters
... string The strings to write
Changes
Changed in version 1.81.0: Multiple arguments are now allowed.
Types
 Handle
A file handle which can be read or written to.

Handle.close()
Source
Close this file handle, freeing any resources it uses.

Returns
true If this handle was successfully closed.
Or
nil If this file handle could not be closed.
string The reason it could not be closed.
Throws
If this handle was already closed.

Handle.flush()
Source
Flush any buffered output, forcing it to be written to the file

Throws
If the handle has been closed

Handle.lines(...)
Source
Returns an iterator that, each time it is called, returns a new line from the file.

This can be used in a for loop to iterate over all lines of a file

Once the end of the file has been reached, nil will be returned. The file is not automatically closed.

Parameters
... The argument to pass to Handle:read for each line.
Returns
function():string | nil The line iterator.
Throws
If the file cannot be opened for reading

Usage
Iterate over every line in a file and print it out.

Run ·êÖlocal file = io.open("/rom/help/intro.txt")
for line in file:lines() do
  print(line)
end
file:close()
See also
io.lines
Changes
New in version 1.3
Handle.read(...)
Source
Reads data from the file, using the specified formats. For each format provided, the function returns either the data read, or nil if no data could be read.

The following formats are available:

l: Returns the next line (without a newline on the end).
L: Returns the next line (with a newline on the end).
a: Returns the entire rest of the file.
~~n: Returns a number~~ (not implemented in CC).
These formats can be preceded by a * to make it compatible with Lua 5.1.

If no format is provided, l is assumed.

Parameters
... The formats to use.
Returns
string | nil... The data read from the file.
Handle.seek([whence [, offset]])
Source
Seeks the file cursor to the specified position, and returns the new position.

whence controls where the seek operation starts, and is a string that may be one of these three values:

set: base position is 0 (beginning of the file)
cur: base is current position
end: base is end of file
The default value of whence is cur, and the default value of offset is 0. This means that file:seek() without arguments returns the current position without moving.

Parameters
whence? string The place to set the cursor from.
offset? number The offset from the start to move to.
Returns
number The new location of the file cursor.
Handle.setvbuf(mode [, size])
Source
üõà DEPRECATED
This has no effect in CC.

Sets the buffering mode for an output file.

This has no effect under ComputerCraft, and exists with compatility with base Lua.

Parameters
mode string The buffering mode.
size? number The size of the buffer.
See also
file:setvbuf Lua's documentation for setvbuf.
Handle.write(...)
Source
Write one or more values to the file

Parameters
... string | number The values to write.
Returns
Handle The current file, allowing chained calls.
Or
nil If the file could not be written to.
string The error message which occurred while writing.
Changes
Changed in version 1.81.0: Multiple arguments are now allowed.
