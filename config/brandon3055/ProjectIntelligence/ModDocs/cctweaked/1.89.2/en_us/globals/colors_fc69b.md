colors
Constants and functions for colour values, suitable for working with term and redstone.

This is useful in conjunction with Bundled Cables from mods like Project Red, and colors on Advanced Computers and Advanced Monitors.

For the non-American English version just replace colors with colours. This alternative API is exactly the same, except the colours use British English (e.g. colors.gray is spelt colours.grey).

On basic terminals (such as the Computer and Monitor), all the colors are converted to grayscale. This means you can still use all 16 colors on the screen, but they will appear as the nearest tint of gray. You can check if a terminal supports color by using the function term.isColor.

Grayscale colors are calculated by taking the average of the three components, i.e. (red + green + blue) / 3.
