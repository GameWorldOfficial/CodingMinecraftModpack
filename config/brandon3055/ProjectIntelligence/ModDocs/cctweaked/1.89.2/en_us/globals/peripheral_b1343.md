peripheral
Find and control peripherals attached to this computer.

Peripherals are blocks (or turtle and pocket computer upgrades) which can be controlled by a computer. For instance, the speaker peripheral allows a computer to play music and the monitor peripheral allows you to display text in the world.

Referencing peripherals
Computers can interact with adjacent peripherals. Each peripheral is given a name based on which direction it is in. For instance, a disk drive below your computer will be called "bottom" in your Lua code, one to the left called "left" , and so on for all 6 directions ("bottom", "top", "left", "right", "front", "back").

You can list the names of all peripherals with the peripherals program, or the peripheral.getNames function.

It's also possible to use peripherals which are further away from your computer through the use of Wired Modems. Place one modem against your computer, run Networking Cable to your peripheral, and then place another modem against that block. You can then right click the modem to use (or attach) the peripheral. This will print a peripheral name to chat, which can then be used just like a direction name to access the peripheral. You can click on the message to copy the name to your clipboard.

Using peripherals
Once you have the name of a peripheral, you can call functions on it using the peripheral.call function. This takes the name of our peripheral, the name of the function we want to call, and then its arguments.

üõà INFO
Some bits of the peripheral API call peripheral functions methods instead (for example, the peripheral.getMethods function). Don't worry, they're the same thing!

Let's say we have a monitor above our computer (and so "top") and want to write some text to it. We'd write the following:

Run ·êÖperipheral.call("top", "write", "This is displayed on a monitor!")
Once you start calling making a couple of peripheral calls this can get very repetitive, and so we can wrap a peripheral. This builds a table of all the peripheral's functions so you can use it like an API or module.

For instance, we could have written the above example as follows:

Run ·êÖlocal my_monitor = peripheral.wrap("top")
my_monitor.write("This is displayed on a monitor!")
Finding peripherals
Sometimes when you're writing a program you don't care what a peripheral is called, you just need to know it's there. For instance, if you're writing a music player, you just need a speaker - it doesn't matter if it's above or below the computer.

Thankfully there's a quick way to do this: peripheral.find. This takes a peripheral type and returns all the attached peripherals which are of this type.

What is a peripheral type though? This is a string which describes what a peripheral is, and so what functions are available on it. For instance, speakers are just called "speaker", and monitors "monitor". Some peripherals might have more than one type - a Minecraft chest is both a "minecraft:chest" and "inventory".

You can get all the types a peripheral has with peripheral.getType, and check a peripheral is a specific type with peripheral.hasType.

To return to our original example, let's use peripheral.find to find an attached speaker:

Run ·êÖlocal speaker = peripheral.find("speaker")
speaker.playNote("harp")

getNames()
Source
Provides a list of all peripherals available.

If a device is located directly next to the system, then its name will be listed as the side it is attached to. If a device is attached via a Wired Modem, then it'll be reported according to its name on the wired network.

Returns
{ string... } A list of the names of all attached peripherals.
Changes
New in version 1.51
isPresent(name)
Source
Determines if a peripheral is present with the given name.

Parameters
name string The side or network name that you want to check.
Returns
boolean If a peripheral is present with the given name.
Usage
Run ·êÖperipheral.isPresent("top")
Run ·êÖperipheral.isPresent("monitor_0")
getType(peripheral)
Source
Get the types of a named or wrapped peripheral.

Parameters
peripheral string | table The name of the peripheral to find, or a wrapped peripheral instance.
Returns
string... The peripheral's types, or nil if it is not present.
Usage
Get the type of a peripheral above this computer.

Run ·êÖperipheral.getType("top")
Changes
Changed in version 1.88.0: Accepts a wrapped peripheral as an argument.
Changed in version 1.99: Now returns multiple types.
hasType(peripheral, peripheral_type)
Source
Check if a peripheral is of a particular type.

Parameters
peripheral string | table The name of the peripheral or a wrapped peripheral instance.
peripheral_type string The type to check.
Returns
boolean | nil If a peripheral has a particular type, or nil if it is not present.
Changes
New in version 1.99
getMethods(name)
Source
Get all available methods for the peripheral with the given name.

Parameters
name string The name of the peripheral to find.
Returns
{ string... } | nil A list of methods provided by this peripheral, or nil if it is not present.
getName(peripheral)
Source
Get the name of a peripheral wrapped with peripheral.wrap.

Parameters
peripheral table The peripheral to get the name of.
Returns
string The name of the given peripheral.
Changes
New in version 1.88.0
call(name, method, ...)
Source
Call a method on the peripheral with the given name.

Parameters
name string The name of the peripheral to invoke the method on.
method string The name of the method
... Additional arguments to pass to the method
Returns
The return values of the peripheral method.
Usage
Open the modem on the top of this computer.

Run ·êÖperipheral.call("top", "open", 1)
wrap(name)
Source
Get a table containing all functions available on a peripheral. These can then be called instead of using peripheral.call every time.

Parameters
name string The name of the peripheral to wrap.
Returns
table | nil The table containing the peripheral's methods, or nil if there is no peripheral present with the given name.
Usage
Open the modem on the top of this computer.

Run ·êÖlocal modem = peripheral.wrap("top")
modem.open(1)
find(ty [, filter])
Source
Find all peripherals of a specific type, and return the wrapped peripherals.

Parameters
ty string The type of peripheral to look for.
filter? function(name: string, wrapped: table):boolean A filter function, which takes the peripheral's name and wrapped table and returns if it should be included in the result.
Returns
table... 0 or more wrapped peripherals matching the given filters.
Usage
Find all monitors and store them in a table, writing "Hello" on each one.

Run ·êÖlocal monitors = { peripheral.find("monitor") }
for _, monitor in pairs(monitors) do
  monitor.write("Hello")
end
Find all wireless modems connected to this computer.

Run ·êÖlocal modems = { peripheral.find("modem", function(name, modem)
    return modem.isWireless() -- Check this modem is wireless.
end) }
This abuses the filter argument to call rednet.open on every modem.

Run ·êÖperipheral.find("modem", rednet.open)
