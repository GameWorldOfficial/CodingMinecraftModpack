fs
Interact with the computer's files and filesystem, allowing you to manipulate files, directories and paths. This includes:

Reading and writing files: Call open to obtain a file "handle", which can be used to read from or write to a file.
Path manipulation: combine, getName and getDir allow you to manipulate file paths, joining them together or extracting components.
Querying paths: For instance, checking if a file exists, or whether it's a directory. See getSize, exists, isDir, isReadOnly and attributes.
File and directory manipulation: For instance, moving or copying files. See makeDir, move, copy and delete.
üõà NOTE
All functions in the API work on absolute paths, and do not take the current directory into account. You can use shell.resolve to convert a relative path into an absolute one.

Mounts
While a computer can only have one hard drive and filesystem, other filesystems may be "mounted" inside it. For instance, the drive peripheral mounts its disk's contents at "disk/", "disk1/", etc...

You can see which mount a path belongs to with the getDrive function. This returns "hdd" for the computer's main filesystem ("/"), "rom" for the rom ("rom/").

Most filesystems have a limited capacity, operations which would cause that capacity to be reached (such as writing an incredibly large file) will fail. You can see a mount's capacity with getCapacity and the remaining space with getFreeSpace.

isDriveRoot(path)
Source
Returns true if a path is mounted to the parent filesystem.

The root filesystem "/" is considered a mount, along with disk folders and the rom folder. Other programs (such as network shares) can exstend this to make other mount types by correctly assigning their return value for getDrive.

Parameters
path string The path to check.
Returns
boolean If the path is mounted, rather than a normal file/folder.
Throws
If the path does not exist.

Changes
New in version 1.87.0
complete(path, location [, include_files [, include_dirs]])
Source
Provides completion for a file or directory name, suitable for use with _G.read.

When a directory is a possible candidate for completion, two entries are included - one with a trailing slash (indicating that entries within this directory exist) and one without it (meaning this entry is an immediate completion candidate). include_dirs can be set to false to only include those with a trailing slash.

Parameters
path string The path to complete.
location string The location where paths are resolved from.
include_files? boolean When false, only directories will be included in the returned list.
include_dirs? boolean When false, "raw" directories will not be included in the returned list.
Returns
{ string... } A list of possible completion candidates.
Changes
New in version 1.74
