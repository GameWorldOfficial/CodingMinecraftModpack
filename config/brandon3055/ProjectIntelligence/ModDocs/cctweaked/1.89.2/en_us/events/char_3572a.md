char
The char event is fired when a character is typed on the keyboard.

The char event is different to a key press. Sometimes multiple key presses may result in one character being typed (for instance, on some European keyboards). Similarly, some keys (e.g. Ctrl) do not have any corresponding character. The key should be used if you want to listen to key presses themselves.

Return values
string: The event name.
string: The string representing the character that was pressed.
Example
Prints each character the user presses:

Run ᐅwhile true do
  local event, character = os.pullEvent("char")
  print(character .. " was pressed.")
end
