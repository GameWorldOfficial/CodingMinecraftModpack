websocket_success
The websocket_success event is fired when a WebSocket connection request returns successfully.

This event is normally handled inside http.websocket, but it can still be seen when using http.websocketAsync.

Return Values
string: The event name.
string: The URL of the site.
http.Websocket: The handle for the WebSocket.
Example
Prints the content of a website (this may fail if the request fails):

Run ·êÖlocal myURL = "wss://example.tweaked.cc/echo"
http.websocketAsync(myURL)
local event, url, handle
repeat
    event, url, handle = os.pullEvent("websocket_success")
until url == myURL
print("Connected to " .. url)
handle.send("Hello!")
print(handle.receive())
handle.close()
