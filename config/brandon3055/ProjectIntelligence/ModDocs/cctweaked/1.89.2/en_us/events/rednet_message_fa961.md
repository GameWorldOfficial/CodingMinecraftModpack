rednet_message
The rednet_message event is fired when a message is sent over Rednet.

This event is usually handled by rednet.receive, but it can also be pulled manually.

rednet_message events are sent by rednet.run in the top-level coroutine in response to modem_message events. A rednet_message event is always preceded by a modem_message event. They are generated inside CraftOS rather than being sent by the ComputerCraft machine.

Return Values
string: The event name.
number: The ID of the sending computer.
any: The message sent.
nil: The protocol of the message, if provided.
Example
Prints a message when one is sent:

Run ·êÖwhile true do
  local event, sender, message, protocol = os.pullEvent("rednet_message")
  if protocol ~= nil then
    print("Received message from " .. sender .. " with protocol " .. protocol .. " and message " .. tostring(message))
  else
    print("Received message from " .. sender .. " with message " .. tostring(message))
  end
end
