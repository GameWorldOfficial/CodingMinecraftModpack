cc.require
A pure Lua implementation of the builtin require function and package library.

Generally you do not need to use this module - it is injected into the every program's environment. However, it may be useful when building a custom shell or when running programs yourself.

Usage
Construct the package and require function, and insert them into a custom environment.

Run ·êÖlocal r = require "cc.require"
local env = setmetatable({}, { __index = _ENV })
env.require, env.package = r.make(env, "/")

-- Now we have our own require function, separate to the original.
local r2 = env.require "cc.require"
print(r, r2)
