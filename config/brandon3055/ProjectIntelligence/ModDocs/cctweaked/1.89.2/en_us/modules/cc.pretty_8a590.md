cc.pretty
A pretty printer for rendering data structures in an aesthetically pleasing manner.

In order to display something using cc.pretty, you build up a series of documents. These behave a little bit like strings; you can concatenate them together and then print them to the screen.

However, documents also allow you to control how they should be printed. There are several functions (such as nest and group) which allow you to control the "layout" of the document. When you come to display the document, the 'best' (most compact) layout is used.

The structure of this module is based on A Prettier Printer.

Usage
Print a table to the terminal

Run ᐅlocal pretty = require "cc.pretty"
pretty.pretty_print({ 1, 2, 3 })
Build a custom document and display it

Run ᐅlocal pretty = require "cc.pretty"
pretty.print(pretty.group(pretty.text("hello") .. pretty.space_line .. pretty.text("world")))
Changes
New in version 1.87.0
empty	An empty document.
space	A document with a single space in it.
line	A line break.
space_line	A line break.
text(text [, colour])	Create a new document from a string.
concat(...)	Concatenate several documents together.
nest(depth, doc)	Indent later lines of the given document with the given number of spaces.
group(doc)	Builds a document which is displayed on a single line if there is enough room, or as normal if not.
write(doc [, ribbon_frac=0.6])	Display a document on the terminal.
print(doc [, ribbon_frac=0.6])	Display a document on the terminal with a trailing new line.
render(doc [, width [, ribbon_frac=0.6]])	Render a document, converting it into a string.
pretty(obj [, options])	Pretty-print an arbitrary object, converting it into a document.
pretty_print(obj [, options [, ribbon_frac=0.6]])	A shortcut for calling pretty and print together.
empty
Source
An empty document.

space
Source
A document with a single space in it.

line
Source
A line break. When collapsed with group, this will be replaced with empty.

space_line
Source
A line break. When collapsed with group, this will be replaced with space.

text(text [, colour])
Source
Create a new document from a string.

If your string contains multiple lines, group will flatten the string into a single line, with spaces between each line.

Parameters
text string The string to construct a new document with.
colour? number The colour this text should be printed with. If not given, we default to the current colour.
Returns
Doc The document with the provided text.
Usage
Write some blue text.

Run ᐅlocal pretty = require "cc.pretty"
pretty.print(pretty.text("Hello!", colours.blue))
concat(...)
Source
Concatenate several documents together. This behaves very similar to string concatenation.

Parameters
... Doc | string The documents to concatenate.
Returns
Doc The concatenated documents.
Usage
Run ᐅlocal pretty = require "cc.pretty"
local doc1, doc2 = pretty.text("doc1"), pretty.text("doc2")
print(pretty.concat(doc1, " - ", doc2))
print(doc1 .. " - " .. doc2) -- Also supports ..
nest(depth, doc)
Source
Indent later lines of the given document with the given number of spaces.

For instance, nesting the document

foo
bar
by two spaces will produce

foo
  bar
Parameters
depth number The number of spaces with which the document should be indented.
doc Doc The document to indent.
Returns
Doc The nested document.
Usage
Run ᐅlocal pretty = require "cc.pretty"
print(pretty.nest(2, pretty.text("foo\nbar")))
group(doc)
Source
Builds a document which is displayed on a single line if there is enough room, or as normal if not.

Parameters
doc Doc The document to group.
Returns
Doc The grouped document.
Usage
Uses group to show things being displayed on one or multiple lines.

Run ᐅlocal pretty = require "cc.pretty"
local doc = pretty.group("Hello" .. pretty.space_line .. "World")
print(pretty.render(doc, 5)) -- On multiple lines
print(pretty.render(doc, 20)) -- Collapsed onto one.
write(doc [, ribbon_frac=0.6])
Source
Display a document on the terminal.

Parameters
doc Doc The document to render
ribbon_frac? number = 0.6 The maximum fraction of the width that we should write in.
print(doc [, ribbon_frac=0.6])
Source
Display a document on the terminal with a trailing new line.

Parameters
doc Doc The document to render.
ribbon_frac? number = 0.6 The maximum fraction of the width that we should write in.
render(doc [, width [, ribbon_frac=0.6]])
Source
Render a document, converting it into a string.

Parameters
doc Doc The document to render.
width? number The maximum width of this document. Note that long strings will not be wrapped to fit this width - it is only used for finding the best layout.
ribbon_frac? number = 0.6 The maximum fraction of the width that we should write in.
Returns
string The rendered document as a string.
pretty(obj [, options])
Source
Pretty-print an arbitrary object, converting it into a document.

This can then be rendered with write or print.

Parameters
obj The object to pretty-print.
options? { function_args = boolean, function_source = boolean }
Controls how various properties are displayed.

function_args: Show the arguments to a function if known (false by default).
function_source: Show where the function was defined, instead of function: xxxxxxxx (false by default).
Returns
Doc The object formatted as a document.
Usage
Display a table on the screen

Run ᐅlocal pretty = require "cc.pretty"
pretty.print(pretty.pretty({ 1, 2, 3 }))
See also
pretty_print for a shorthand to prettify and print an object.
Changes
Changed in version 1.88.0: Added options argument.
pretty_print(obj [, options [, ribbon_frac=0.6]])
Source
A shortcut for calling pretty and print together.

Parameters
obj The object to pretty-print.
options? { function_args = boolean, function_source = boolean }
Controls how various properties are displayed.

function_args: Show the arguments to a function if known (false by default).
function_source: Show where the function was defined, instead of function: xxxxxxxx (false by default).
ribbon_frac? number = 0.6 The maximum fraction of the width that we should write in.
Usage
Display a table on the screen.

Run ᐅlocal pretty = require "cc.pretty"
pretty.pretty_print({ 1, 2, 3 })

pretty
print
Changes
New in version 1.99
Types
 Doc
A document containing formatted text, with multiple possible layouts.

Documents effectively represent a sequence of strings in alternative layouts, which we will try to print in the most compact form necessary.
