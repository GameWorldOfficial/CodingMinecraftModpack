cc.shell.completion
A collection of helper methods for working with shell completion.

Most programs may be completed using the build helper method, rather than manually switching on the argument index.

Note, the helper functions within this module do not accept an argument index, and so are not directly usable with the shell.setCompletionFunction. Instead, wrap them using build, or your own custom function.

Usage
Register a completion handler for example.lua which prompts for a choice of options, followed by a directory, and then multiple files.

Run ·êÖlocal completion = require "cc.shell.completion"
local complete = completion.build(
  { completion.choice, { "get", "put" } },
  completion.dir,
  { completion.file, many = true }
)
shell.setCompletionFunction("example.lua", complete)
read(nil, nil, shell.complete, "example ")

build(...)
Source
A helper function for building shell completion arguments.

This accepts a series of single-argument completion functions, and combines them into a function suitable for use with shell.setCompletionFunction.

Parameters
... nil | table | function
Every argument to build represents an argument to the program you wish to complete. Each argument can be one of three types:

nil: This argument will not be completed.

A function: This argument will be completed with the given function. It is called with the shell object, the string to complete and the arguments before this one.

A table: This acts as a more powerful version of the function case. The table must have a function as the first item - this will be called with the shell, string and preceding arguments as above, but also followed by any additional items in the table. This provides a more convenient interface to pass options to your completion functions.

If this table is the last argument, it may also set the many key to true, which states this function should be used to complete any remaining arguments.
